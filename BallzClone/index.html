    <h1>Ballz Clone</h1>
    <p>So this is a clone of the game Ballz by Ketchapp. I am making this for a few reasons. First, Learning how to make a web game. Second, the original has several issues or things that could make the game better and this allows me to make those. Third, this version will be cross platform and will work on any device that has a web browser.</p>
    <p><a href="1.0/index.html">1.0 - WIP - Just the basic clone</a></p>
    <h3>To-Do (These will probably equal version numbers):</h3>
    <p>1. Basic Clone</p>
    <p>2. Main Menu</p>
    <p>3. Saving & High Score Tracking</p>
    <p>4. Auto Resolution   Until this is out, it will only work for 1080p desktop</p>
    <p>5. Speed Slider</p>
    <p>6. Super Optimized Mode</p>
    <p>7. Undo Button</p>
    <p>8. AI Button</p>
